This project contains our implentation of a Virtual Machine Mapping Policy based on load balancing in private cloud environment.

The policy uses the resource consumption of the running virtual machine and the self-adaptive weighted approach, which resolves the load balancing conflicts of each independent resource caused by different demand for resources of cloud applications. Meanwhile, it uses a probabilistic approach to ease the problem of load crowding in the concurrent users scene.

## Installation

- Client Node

```
1. Download an ISO File for Ubuntu.
2. Download virt-manager on all client nodes.
3. Clone a VM using the ISO File obtained in step 1.
4. Enable qemu-guest-agent on this VM.
5. Add test programs in the VM and convert them into executable binaries.
6. Save the qcow2 image of this VM.
7. Use the qcow2 image of this VM to clone new VMs when a request arrives.
```

## Run Locally

Clone the project on all client nodes and master node.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Akuver/Load_Balancer_Implementation.git
```

Go to the project directory clientNode and masterNode when setting up for Client Node and Master Node respectively.

```bash
  cd Load_Balancer_Implementation/Integration/clientNode
  cd Load_Balancer_Implementation/Integration/masterNode
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the client servers first and only then the master server.

```bash
  npm run start
```
